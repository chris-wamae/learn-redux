                    African girls from poor families miss 20 % of school days in a year due to lack of sanitary towels. Our mission is to solve this problem by not just providing sanitary towels but also providing clean water and sanitation facilities such as toilets to ensure they are able to meet the guidelines for proper menstrual hygiene as defined by UNICEF.
